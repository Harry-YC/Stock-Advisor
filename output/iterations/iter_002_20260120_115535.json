Ackman\u2019s latest 13F (filed August 14, 2023) showed no NVDA holdings, and no new activity reported on X.\n   - **Stanley Druckenmiller (Duquesne Family Office)**: No new 13F filings or specific NVDA updates in the last 7 days.

        "content": "## Key Findings\n- **Unusual Options Activity**: On November 5, 2024, a significant options flow was reported for NVDA with a large premium of $1.2M on the $140 strike calls expiring November 8, 2024. This was flagged as unusual by @unusual_whales on X, indicating bullish sentiment with aggressive buying above the ask price. Additionally, a sweep order for $800K in premium was noted on the $145 strike calls for the same expiration, suggesting strong conviction for an upward move.\n- **Gamma Exposure (GEX)**: Posts from @GammaSqueeze on November 4, 2024, highlighted NVDA's GEX levels nearing a critical threshold at the $140 strike, with potential for a gamma squeeze if the stock breaks above this level. They estimate a dealer gamma position of +$2.5B at $140, which could amplify price movement if triggered.\n- **Put/Call Ratio**: Data shared by @OptionsMike on November 6, 2024, shows NVDA's put/call ratio dropping to 0.6, down from 0.9 a week prior, indicating a shift toward bullish sentiment as call buying outpaces puts. This is based on aggregated flow data from major options platforms.\n- **Sweep Orders**: On November 5, 2024, @Cheds reported a massive sweep of NVDA $142 calls expiring November 15, 2024, with a premium of $950K, executed in a single block above the ask, signaling strong institutional buying and bullish intent.\n- **VIX Commentary**: @VolatilityWiz noted on November 6, 2024, that implied volatility for NVDA options (IV around 45%) remains elevated compared to the broader market VIX (currently at 18.5), suggesting traders are pricing in a significant move post-earnings (expected November 20, 2024). They speculate this could be tied to uncertainty around AI sector growth.\n\n## Notable Voices\n- **@unusual_whales**: \"NVDA $140C 11/8 expiry - $1.2M premium, above ask. Bullish flow continues. 11/5/24\"\n- **@GammaSqueeze**: \"NVDA GEX at $140 strike is +$2.5B. Dealers hedged heavy.
