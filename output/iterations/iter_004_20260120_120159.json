        "content": "I\u2019ve conducted a real-time search on X for institutional activity related to ONDS (Ondas Holdings Inc.) with a focus on the last 7 days (as of October 2023). I used search terms like \"ONDS 13F filing,\" \"ONDS hedge fund,\" \"ONDS institutional buying,\" \"ONDS whale alert,\" and \"ONDS insider trading.\" Below is a structured summary of the findings. Note that information on X is often fragmented or speculative, and I\u2019ve distinguished between confirmed facts and unverified claims.\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings\n- **13F Filings**: No specific mentions of recent 13F filings for ONDS involving high-profile investors like Michael Burry, Bill Ackman, or Stanley Druckenmiller in the last 7 days on X. Historical data or older filings are not referenced in current posts. A broader check of SEC filings (outside X) also shows no new 13F updates for these names specific to ONDS in the immediate past week.\n- **Hedge Fund Moves**: No explicit posts on X in the last 7 days detailing new stakes, exits, or large position changes by hedge funds in ONDS. One user, @StockMKTNewz, posted on October 23, 2023, about general institutional ownership in ONDS, stating that \"institutional ownership stands at ~27% of float,\" but no specific fund names or recent moves were cited.\n- **Smart Money**: Limited chatter on institutional accumulation or distribution for ONDS. A speculative post by @TraderJoeXYZ on October 21, 2023, mentioned \"smart money might be eyeing ONDS under $1.00 for a potential swing,\" but this lacks confirmation or evidence of actual institutional buying.\n- **Whale Activity**: No mentions of large block trades or dark pool prints for ONDS in the last 7 days on X. A search for \"ONDS whale alert\" yielded no results tied to specific transactions or volumes.\n- **Insider Trading**: No recent insider buying or selling activity for ONDS was discussed on X in the last 7 days. A post by @InsiderTrackr on October 20, 2023, referenced historical insider buying from Q2 2023, but nothing current or action",

        "content": "## Key Findings\n- **Hot Sectors**: Over the past 7 days (as of October 25, 2023), technology and AI-related stocks continue to lead the market, with significant mentions of strength in semiconductors and software. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) saw inflows of approximately $1.2 billion in the week ending October 20, 2023, per data shared on X by @ETFResearchCtr on October 23, 2023. AI as a theme remains dominant, with companies like NVIDIA and AMD frequently cited as outperformers.\n- **Cold Sectors**: Energy stocks are lagging, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) experiencing outflows of $800 million in the same week, per @ETFResearchCtr on October 23, 2023. Posts on X highlight underperformance in oil and gas due to declining crude oil prices, with WTI crude dropping below $70/barrel as of October 24, 2023, per @OilPriceUpdate.\n- **Rotation Signals**: There are clear indications of money moving from energy and industrials into technology and consumer discretionary. @StockMarketNerd posted on October 22, 2023, about a noticeable shift in institutional buying toward tech ETFs like QQQ (+2.5% week-over-week) while XLE declined by 3.1% in the same period. This suggests a risk-on sentiment.\n- **Cyclical vs Defensive**: Recent X chatter points to a risk-on environment, with cyclical sectors like tech and consumer discretionary outperforming defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. @MarketAnalystX noted on October 21, 2023, that the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) is down 1.8% over the past week, while cyclical sectors are gaining traction.\n- **Theme Plays**: AI remains a dominant theme, with frequent mentions of infrastructure spending boosting tech hardware. Energy transition plays (e.g., renewables) are also gaining traction despite broader energy sector weakness, as highlighted by @GreenEnergyInv on October 23, 2023, pointing to a 4% uptick in the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN).\n- **Specific to ONDS (Ondas Holdings Inc.)**: There",

The search targeted keywords like \"ONDS options flow,\" \"ONDS unusual activity,\" \"ONDS gamma squeeze,\" \"ONDS calls,\" \"ONDS puts,\" and \"VIX.\" Below are the findings, formatted as requested, with specific data points, @handles, and distinctions between confirmed facts and speculation.\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings\n- **Unusual Options Activity**: On October 28, 2023, a post by @OptionsMike highlighted unusual call activity in ONDS, specifically mentioning a large premium of $85,000 spent on **November 17, 2023, $2.50 strike calls**. This was flagged as a bullish signal with a significant increase in volume compared to open interest (exact OI not specified in the post). Current stock price (as of October 30, 2023) is approximately $1.80, making these calls out-of-the-money (OTM) and speculative.\n- **Gamma Exposure (GEX)**: Limited direct mentions of GEX or gamma squeeze potential for ONDS in the past 7 days. However, @TradeWithAlerts speculated on October 27, 2023, that the recent call buying at higher strikes could lead to \"potential gamma pressure\" if ONDS breaks above $2.00, though no specific GEX levels or dealer exposure data were provided. This remains speculative.\n- **Put/Call Ratios**: No specific put/call ratio data for ONDS was widely shared on X in the last 7 days. Sentiment from options flow posts leans bullish due to the dominance of call buying mentions over puts. A post by @FlowAlgo on October 29, 2023, noted \"heavy call flow\" in ONDS without quantifying the ratio.\n- **Sweep Orders**: On October 28, 2023, @UnusualWhales reported a sweep order for ONDS calls, specifically **1,200 contracts of November 17, 2023, $2.50 strike calls** bought above the ask price, indicating aggressive bullish buying.
